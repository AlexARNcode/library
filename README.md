# library

This is a simple backend REST API that I have created to learn NodeJS.
It is used to manage your books, you can:
- See the list of all books of the library
- See a specific book
- Add a new book
- Update a book
- Delete a book

I am just mocking a database at the moment, using a simple array, but maybe I will integrate a real database later.
